The issues I found in lab 1 is more about convience and small improvements to the code. I think all imports once known can be moved to the top cell that way all imports are loaded at first to insure code integrity when running it. Another thing is isolate the cells better in way where variables are only used for that specific section it can stay in that section, but if variables are used often throughout the code maybe there can be a separate cell to define it (It will probably be consider a global variable and I prefer to avoid those). Another thing if length syntax is often use, it probably will make the code easier to read by putting it into a variable. For exampel X_reduced[X['category_name'] == category] ... is fairly lengthy and often used, but I also think it is unecessary to change most stuff into variable as it could be more difficult to see what is happening with the code. Could probably add more functions also to shorten the code if there repeated methods, but I think this will be more important if we are working on larger datasets.
